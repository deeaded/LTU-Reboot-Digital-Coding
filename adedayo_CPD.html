  <div><h2>CPD  - Java Script</h2>
    <P>
      1st session on Java Script. It has been a struggle trying to catch up on missed lesson and tasks,this has been due to the fact that workdemand has meant that I have been bringing loads of work back home to catch up now. <br>I am releived that i am finally able to get back into watching the recorded lessons, with the hope of catching up fully before the end of the course.</br>From watching the recorded session on Javascript, I learnt about setting variables, types of data, and using operations. I was able to transfer some knowledge of using MS excel formula into how the operations work in javascript. <br>I now understand the difference between using console.log to output to console and using document.write to output to webpages.</br> </P>
